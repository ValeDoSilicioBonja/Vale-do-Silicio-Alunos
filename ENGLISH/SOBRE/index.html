        The Marli Medeiros Cultural Center (CEMME) has been operating for over 15 years, promoting social activities for
        children and adolescents in the Bom Jesus neighborhood, with the aim of improving the community and guaranteeing
        social rights. Recognizing the need for innovation in teaching methodologies and digital inclusion, the
        organization proposes the Bom Jesus Innovation and Technology Center project, focusing on:

        1. Technological empowerment of vulnerable populations, reducing inequality in access to and production of technology.

        2. Womenâ€™s development and inclusion, prioritizing women as beneficiaries to address gender inequalities, especially in the tech field.

        The proposal aims to prepare the community for the demands of the digital world, promoting social transformation and
        strengthening women's participation in productive and technological sectors.

        <p class="bio"> Born in Bom Jesus, I participated in CEA, specifically attending the "Projovem" program, leaving at the age of 17 to start a young apprentice program. Always interested in technology, specifically in Computing, I joined hardware programs and later switched to programming, where I've been working for 2 years in projects and internships. I am currently studying System Development Analysis and taking a digital marketing course at LaSalle. I work as an audiovisual technician at the podcasts "Passada Esportiva" and "Quebrada em Foco," available on YouTube, and I am 22 years old.

        <p class="bio">When I started as a social educator, I didn't really understand how the service worked. Today, I feel fulfilled in being able to welcome and help young people,
          preparing them to look at life and opportunities in a positive way.
          In the voucher project, I helped prepare the snacks, always thinking about offering tasty and nutritious food,
          I left everything organized with care and affection for the young people in the course.</p>
